# PROJECT BRIEFING

A. TITLE: CAPEX MANAGEMENT

B. SALIENT FEATURES:

In this project three tables named DEPT1, CAPEX and SCHEME1 are used.
DEPT1 stores the department names corresponding to the department code.
CAPEX stores the maximum budget that has been allocated for a particular item for a particular department and for a particular financial year.
SCHEME1 is a table which takes in its input from the user with the help of the SCHEME ENTRY form that has been designed to take scheme values input for the particular item for the particular department for that particular financial year and adds to the database table.
The other features are:

If the scheme value entered is such that the sum of the other stored scheme values exceeds the capex for that particular item for the department for that particular financial year, then it shows an alert “Budget Limit Exceeded”.
All the fields have been validated by their respective checks and any violation will result to no entry in database with a proper alert message.
